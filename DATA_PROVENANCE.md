# Data Provenance

## Why provenance matters

This is emergency data. If a phone number here is wrong or stale, someone trying
to reach the police, an ambulance, or a poison-control centre during a real
crisis reaches a dead line instead — staleness has a human cost, measured in
minutes that matter. That is why every record in this dataset carries an explicit
audit trail: where it came from, how it was checked, and when it was last
checked. A record without provenance is not data we will ship, because it is not
data a developer can responsibly route a person toward. Provenance is not
metadata garnish; it is the contract that makes this dataset usable for the
purpose it exists for.

## Verification methods explained

Every record's provenance includes a `verification_method`, one of four values
(the `VerificationMethod` enum). Choose the strongest method available for the
record:

| Method | Value | When it applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual call | `manual_call` | A human dialed the number and confirmed it reaches the stated service. The strongest evidence for a contact number — preferred for county-level emergency contacts and poison-control lines. |
| Official publication | `official_publication` | The record is taken from an authoritative published source (Kenya Gazette, a government directory, an official agency notice). Best for stable facts like county codes and nationally mandated short codes (999, 112). |
| Website check | `website_check` | The value was read from the official website of the responsible body (a county government, the Kenya Red Cross). Use when a published document or a manual call isn't available, and record the exact URL. |
| Machine imported | `machine_imported` | The record was bulk-imported from a dataset and has **not** yet been independently verified by a human. This is the weakest level — treat such records as provisional and prioritize them for re-verification. |

## Snapshot file inventory

The dataset ships as versioned JSON snapshots in `data/snapshots/`. Each file is
an array of records; every record carries a required `provenance` object
(`source`, `source_url`, `last_verified_at`, `verification_method`, `notes`).
Phone numbers are normalized to E.164 on load.

### `counties_v1.json`

The 47 constitutionally defined counties.

| Field | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| `code` | County code, `"001"`–`"047"` (three digits, zero-padded). |
| `name` | County name, e.g. `"Nairobi"`. |
| `capital` | County headquarters / capital town. |
| `region` | Optional broader grouping, e.g. `"Coast"` (free-form, may be null). |
| `provenance` | Required. Typically `official_publication` (Kenya Gazette). |

### `emergency_contacts_v1.json`

County-scoped emergency services with full dialable numbers.

| Field | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| `county_code` | The county served, `"001"`–`"047"`. Must match a county. |
| `category` | One of: `police`, `fire`, `ambulance`, `redcross`, `gbv`, `child_helpline`, `general`. |
| `name` | Service name, e.g. `"Nairobi County Fire Brigade"`. |
| `phone_numbers` | At least one full number; normalized to E.164. No short codes here. |
| `notes` | Optional free-form context (e.g. `"Operations desk"`). |
| `provenance` | Required. Prefer `manual_call` for contact numbers. |

### `national_emergency_numbers_v1.json`

Nationwide services reachable by a short dialer code.

| Field | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| `service_name` | Service name, e.g. `"Police Emergency"`. |
| `short_code` | 3–5 digit dialer code (`"999"`, `"112"`, `"1199"`) — a code, not a phone number. |
| `alternate_numbers` | Optional full-format alternate lines, normalized to E.164. |
| `category` | Same category vocabulary as emergency contacts. |
| `description` | Human-readable description of the service. |
| `provenance` | Required. Prefer `official_publication` for mandated codes. |

### `poison_control_v1.json`

Poison information / control centres.

| Field | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Centre name, e.g. `"KEMRI Poisons Information Centre"`. |
| `phone_numbers` | At least one full number; normalized to E.164. |
| `short_codes` | Optional 3–5 digit dialer codes. |
| `address` | Optional physical address. |
| `hours` | Optional operating hours, e.g. `"24/7"`. |
| `scope` | `"national"` or `"regional"`. |
| `region` | Required when `scope == "regional"`; otherwise null. |
| `provenance` | Required. Prefer `manual_call`. |

## Re-verification cadence (policy)

Emergency data decays. The following re-verification schedule is **policy**, not
a suggestion — a record whose `last_verified_at` is older than its cadence is
considered stale and must be re-verified before the next release:

| Data category | Re-verify every |
| --- | --- |
| National emergency numbers | 12 months |
| Per-county emergency contacts | 6 months |
| Poison control centres | 12 months |

County administrative facts (codes, names, capitals) change only with
constitutional/legal amendment and are re-verified opportunistically rather than
on a fixed clock.

## Verification checklist for new records

Before a record is added or updated, the contributor confirms:

- [ ] The number was reached or confirmed via the strongest method available
      (a `manual_call` beats a `website_check` beats an unverified import).
- [ ] `verification_method` honestly reflects what was actually done — never
      claim `manual_call` for a number that was only read off a page.
- [ ] `source` names the specific responsible body, not a generic aggregator.
- [ ] `source_url` points to the canonical page for that source where one exists.
- [ ] `last_verified_at` is the date the check was *actually performed*.
- [ ] Phone numbers are real, in service, and reach the stated service (not a
      switchboard that has since changed).
- [ ] `category` / `scope` are correct, and `county_code` (where present) maps to
      a real county.
- [ ] Anything uncertain is captured in `notes` rather than silently dropped.

_Empty for now. Populated after curation — this section will honestly document
coverage gaps, counties with thin data, records pending re-verification, and any
